# Solver Scores
## Explanation
The solvers are stored in JSON files under solvers/json/. These files contain
all the guesses the solver will do depending on the matches thus far. This
file is generated by `generate_json_solvers.py` to score each solver. These
scores can be used to compare solvers and see improvements as we write new
ones.
